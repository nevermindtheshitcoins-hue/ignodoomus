# Stage 4 Complete — Real AI Integration

Date: (auto)

## Deliverables
- Connected the assessment flow to the OpenAI client so real AI questions and narratives are requested whenever an API key is present (`src/components/logic/useAssessmentFlow.ts`).
- Added reusable helpers to build prompt context, normalise question options, and summarise user answers for prompt injection (`src/components/logic/mockContent.ts`).
- Extended the standalone effects service to call OpenAI with the same context-aware prompts, falling back to industry-specific mocks when no key is configured (`src/components/logic/effects.ts`).
- Loosened industry matching to handle fuzzy custom labels, preserving defaults and proof-point lookups (`src/components/content/industryProfiles.ts`).
- Documented integration behaviour, fallbacks, and outstanding risks.

## Files Created
- `docs/STAGE4_COMPLETE.md`

## Files Modified
- `src/components/content/industryProfiles.ts`
- `src/components/logic/mockContent.ts`
- `src/components/logic/preliminaryAnswers.ts`
- `src/components/logic/useAssessmentFlow.ts`
- `src/components/logic/effects.ts`

## Behaviour Changes
- When an OpenAI API key is available (or `enableOpenAI` option supplied), the UI now requests tailored AI questions and narratives. Responses are trimmed, normalised to six options, and tagged with `source: 'ai'` to distinguish them from mocks.
- Question prompts and narrative requests embed resolved role/industry/pain descriptions plus a summary of user answers, improving AI specificity.
- In the absence of an API key or on error, the system automatically falls back to the Stage 3 industry-aware mock outputs.

## Validation
- `npx vite build` ✅
- `npm run build` ❌ (pre-existing strict TypeScript issues in `src/components/app/StateMachine.ts`, `FooterControls.tsx`, and `ErrorBoundary.tsx` still block the type-checking pipeline).

## Follow-Up / Risks
- Tighten TypeScript types around the XState machine and footer focus trap so `npm run build` passes before CI gating.
- Expand answer summarisation with richer context once Stage 5 introduces structured proof-point weighting in prompts.
- Consider rate limiting / cancellation safeguards around OpenAI requests for long-running sessions.

## Next Stages Preview
- Stage 5: Deployment configuration (Vercel + iframe readiness) — leverage new build output and iframe bridge.
- Stage 6: Final validation — resolve outstanding TS errors, add monitoring hooks, and certify accessibility.
