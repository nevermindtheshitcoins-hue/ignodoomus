# Stage 3 Complete — Industry-Specific Content

Date: (auto)

## Deliverables
- Added structured industry profiles with five tailored question templates per sector, narrative guidance, and proof point weighting (`src/components/content/industryProfiles.ts`).
- Built reusable helpers to resolve preliminary answers and compose industry-aware mock questions/narratives (`src/components/logic/preliminaryAnswers.ts`, `src/components/logic/mockContent.ts`).
- Updated both fallback pipelines (effects + React hook) to generate contextual questions and narratives instead of generic placeholders.
- Mock narrative output now mirrors the final Stage 4 structure (executive summary, implementation, technical, outcomes, proof points, next steps) for easier comparison once real AI is wired up.

## Files Created
- `src/components/content/industryProfiles.ts`
- `src/components/logic/preliminaryAnswers.ts`
- `src/components/logic/mockContent.ts`
- `docs/STAGE3_COMPLETE.md`

## Files Modified
- `src/components/logic/useAssessmentFlow.ts`
- `src/components/logic/effects.ts`
- `src/components/content/industryProfiles.ts`
- `src/components/logic/mockContent.ts`

## Behaviour Changes
- When AI generation is unavailable, users now receive question sets that reference their role, industry, and pain point.
- Mock narratives adopt the correct document vessel (e.g., Case Study, Regulatory Submission) with proof points tuned by pain point keywords.
- Proof point metadata centralised for reuse in Stage 4 prompt construction.

## Validation
- `npx vite build` ✅
- `npm run build` ❌ (Existing strict TypeScript issues remain in `StateMachine.ts`, `FooterControls.tsx`, and `ErrorBoundary.tsx`; unchanged during Stage 3.)

## Follow-Up / Risks
- Stage 4 should hook the real OpenAI service and replace mock generators while preserving new industry metadata.
- Address outstanding TypeScript errors ahead of CI integration to unblock `npm run build`.
- Consider snapshot tests for question/narrative builders once real AI responses can be recorded.

## Next Stage Preview (Stage 4)
- Swap mock effects with calls to `openaiService.ts` using the new metadata to enrich prompts.
- Harden error handling paths and retry UX around real API failures.
- Ensure postMessage bridge relays error states for iframe embedding.
